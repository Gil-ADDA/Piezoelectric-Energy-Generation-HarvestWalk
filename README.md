# Piezoelectric-Energy-Generation-HarvestWalk-For-IOT 
The primary goal of this repository is to explore the potential of piezoelectricity for energy generation and develop sustainable solutions for IOT devices. By openly sharing my research findings, experimental setups, component evaluations, and design considerations, I hope to inspire discussions and invite valuable insights from the community


Be involved in this repository - researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts interested in piezoelectric energy **are all welcome!** Share your ideas, feedback, and more to help this project reach its full potential. With everyone's help, we can work towards a more sustainable future. No matter your experience, your input is invaluable - so please reach out and contribute via opening issues, email, or any other suggestions!

## Potential Component List

The "potential Component List" section contains a comprehensive list of components that will be investigated and considered for piezoelectric energy generation research. The list: 
- piezoelectric materials ( what is the best for generate energy) 

- bridge rectifier

- energy storage systems - dose Capacitor is the best for that project? 



By documenting the planned components, we aim to explore the available options, evaluate their suitability for our research objectives, and make informed decisions. This section will be continuously updated as we research and assess different components, providing transparency and facilitating collaboration with the community
