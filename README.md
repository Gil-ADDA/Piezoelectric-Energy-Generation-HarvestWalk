# Piezoelectric-Energy-Generation-HarvestWalk
The primary goal of this repository is to explore the potential of piezoelectricity for energy generation and develop sustainable solutions. By openly sharing my research findings, experimental setups, component evaluations, and design considerations, I hope to inspire discussions and invite valuable insights from the community


Be involved in this repository - researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts interested in piezoelectric energy **are all welcome!** Share your ideas, feedback, and more to help this project reach its full potential. With everyone's help, we can work towards a more sustainable future. No matter your experience, your input is invaluable - so please reach out and contribute via opening issues, email, or any other suggestions!
