# Piezoelectric-Energy-Generation-HarvestWalk-For-IOT 
The primary goal of this repository is to explore the potential of piezoelectricity for energy generation and develop sustainable solutions for IOT devices. By openly sharing my research findings, experimental setups, component evaluations, and design considerations, I hope to inspire discussions and invite valuable insights from the community


Be involved in this repository - researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts interested in piezoelectric energy **are all welcome!** Share your ideas, feedback, and more to help this project reach its full potential. With everyone's help, we can work towards a more sustainable future. No matter your experience, your input is invaluable - so please reach out and contribute via opening issues, email, or any other suggestions!

the piezoelectric tiles can turn steps into energy. Over a year, this energy could replace a portion of electricity usually pulled from the grid. This means less reliance on traditional power sources, which often produce CO2, a greenhouse gas. Plus, it saves money on electricity bills. 
Besides, these tiles can potentially offer a clean, wire-free solution for powering IoT devices. Imagine a city where foot traffic in public spaces like parks, subway stations, or sidewalks generates power for public IoT devices. 

# Problem statment 
With the proliferation of IoT devices in indoor environments like homes and offices, providing a sustainable, wireless power source for these devices is a significant challenge. This is particularly relevant for low-power devices such as temperature or humidity sensors and smart switches, which are frequently used in these settings. The problem is compounded by the need to reduce wire clutter and improve aesthetics. This project aims to investigate whether a piezoelectric tile, harvesting energy from regular foot traffic or other mechanical stimuli in these environments, could generate sufficient power to operate these sensors and switches. A key part of this investigation will be to accurately measure the amount of electrical energy each tile generates.

## Potential Component List

The "potential Component List" section contains a comprehensive list of components that will be investigated and considered for piezoelectric energy generation research. The list: 
- 5 X pizo (piezoelectric materials - what is the best for generate energy?) (Diaphragm)

- Bridge rectifier ( which one is the most suitable?) 

- Energy storage systems - dose Capacitor is the best for that project? 

- Capasitor Microfarad capacitor 10 MF  (max 50 volts ) (for charging ) (what is the speed of charging and why I should consider that ? ) 
how much Microfarad (ÂµF) do i need for that project? 

- Diode (note the energy cost for that is 0.6-0.7 volts)  OR Germanium diode (energy cost of 0.3)

By documenting the planned components, we aim to explore the available options, evaluate their suitability for our research objectives, and make informed decisions. This section will be continuously updated as we research and assess different components, providing transparency and facilitating collaboration with the community


# Design of the tile
List of materials :

Rubber tile: The choice of material is essential here. Rubber is chosen because it is durable, flexible, and resilient, for frequently walking.

Rubber ball: This will be placed in the middle of the tile, acting as the central point of contact. The ball should be small enough to fit comfortably in the space between the two halves of the tile, but large enough to make contact with both piezoelectric sensors when pressure is applied to the tile.
