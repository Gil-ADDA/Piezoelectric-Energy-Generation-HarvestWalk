# Piezoelectric-Energy-Generation-HarvestWalk
The primary goal of this repository is to explore the potential of piezoelectricity for energy generation and develop sustainable solutions. By openly sharing my research findings, experimental setups, component evaluations, and design considerations, I hope to inspire discussions and invite valuable insights from the community
